Troubleshooting
---------------
The official BitPay API documentation should always be your first reference for development: https://bitpay.com/downloads/bitpayApi.pdf

- Verify that your "notificationURL" for the invoice is "https://" (not "http://")
- Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
- Verify that your callback handler at the "notificationURL" is properly receiving POSTs. You can verify this by POSTing your own messages to the server from a tool like Chrome Postman.
- Verify that the POST data received is properly parsed and that the logic that updates the order status on the merchants web server is correct.
- Verify that the merchants web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on the firewall as well, if one is being used.
- Use the logging functionality to log errors during development. If you contact BitPay support, they will ask to see the log file to help diagnose any problems.
- Check the version of this plugin against the official repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version of the library.
- If all else fails, send an email describing your issue in detail to support@bitpay.com
